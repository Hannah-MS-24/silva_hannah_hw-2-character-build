            <h3 class="lb_heading">Dr Sheldon Cooper - Theoretical Physicist</h3>
            <p class="lb_text">Dr. Sheldon Lee Cooper (Jim Parsons) is a theoretical physicist with an I.Q. of 187, possessing a B.S., a M.S., a M.A., a Ph.D., and a Sc.D. Originally from East Texas, he was a child prodigy, starting college at the age of 11, and receiving his first Ph.D. at age 16. He is usually cold, calculating,</p>
            <p class="lb_text">Sheldon exhibits a strict adherence to routine, a lack of understanding of irony, sarcasm and humor, and a complete lack of humility; these characteristics are the main sources of his character's humor and the center of a number of episodes. Sheldon's family is very different from him; his father, George 
                               Sr., was a former store worker who died before the start of the series, while his mother, Mary, is a devoted Christian, and his twin sister, Missy, is a hostess at Fuddruckers and his older brother George Jr. is certainly no scientist.</p>

            <h3 class="lb_heading">Dr. Rajesh Koothrappali - Astrophysics</h3>
            <p class="lb_text">Dr. Rajesh Koothrappali is Howard Wolowitz's best friend, and yet another genius of the group; his name is usually shortened to "Raj". 
                               He is originally from New Delhi, India, and he works in the Physics department at Caltech, where his area of expertise is particle astrophysics. Raj is extremely shy when it comes to dealing with women; he is unable to speak to them unless he drinks alcohol or is on medication.</p>
            <p class="lb_text">When Penny is around, Raj usually whispers what he wants to say to Howard or Leonard, who then responds out loud. Despite his pathology, Raj has often ended up in bed with women, leaving the other guys perplexed. Raj communicates with his parents, Dr. V.M. Koothrappali and Mrs. Koothrappali, in India through a webcam.</p>

            <h3 class="lb_heading">Dr. Leonard Hofstadter - Experimental Physicist</h3>
            <p class="lb_text">Dr. Leonard Hofstadter is an experimental physicist with an IQ of 173 who received his Ph.D. when he was 24 years old. 
                               He formerly shared an apartment with colleague and friend Sheldon Cooper. The writers have toyed with a romance between him and neighbor Penny, with their unresolved sexual tension being a major force for drama.</p>
            <p class="lb_text">Leonard's family includes three other accomplished scientists: his mother, Dr. Beverly Hofstadter who is a psychiatrist and neuroscientist, his father Dr. Alfred Hofstadter who is an anthropologist and his sister 
                               (name unknown) who is a medical researcher, while his brother Michael Hofstadter is a Harvard law professor. Leonard wears glasses and is lactose intolerant.</p>

            <h3 class="lb_heading">Howard Wolowitz - Engineer</h3>
            <p class="lb_text">Howard Wolowitz is a Jewish engineer at Caltech's Department of Applied Physics who often hangs out at Leonard and Sheldon's apartment. 
                               Unlike Sheldon, Leonard, and Rajesh Ramayan Koothrappali, Howard lacks a doctorate</p>
            <p class="lb_text">He defends this by pointing out that he has a master's degree in Engineering from MIT. Howard fancies himself a ladies' man and provides outrageous pick-up lines whenever a female is present. 
                               He still lives with his mother, who is overly oblivious to his accomplishments as an engineer.</p>

            <h3 class="lb_heading">Penny - Aspiring Actress</h3>
            <p class="lb_text">Originally from Omaha, Nebraska, she is a waitress at the local Cheesecake Factory and also an aspiring actress. Penny is very outgoing, kind, and assertive, her personality contrasting with those of the guys. 
                               She has dated several men during the course of the series, including former boyfriend Kurt, Stuart (from the comic book store), and Zack.</p>
            <p class="lb_text">She has shown to be influenced by her geek friends, including an obsession with online gaming and making references to Star Trek, to her own surprise. She even remarked after a bad date with Zack that Leonard had ruined stupid guys for her. 
                               For the most part she cannot stand Sheldon's nerdy, eccentric personality, but at times they have shown to be a sister to him.</p>
